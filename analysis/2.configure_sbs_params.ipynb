    "  ### Alignment\n",
    "  - `ALIGNMENT_METHOD`: Optional. Method for aligning SBS images between cycles. If not specified, the method will be automatically selected based on available channels, but can be overridden by the user:\n",
    "      - `DAPI`: the DAPI channel is used for alignment between cycles. Automatically selected if **DAPI is present in each** round of SBS imaging.\n",
    "      - `sbs_mean`: the mean intensity of base channels is used for alignment between cycles. Automatically selected if **DAPI is not present in each** round of SBS imaging.\n",
    "  - `UPSAMPLE_FACTOR`: Factor used for subpixel alignment. Defaults to `2`\n",
    "      - Higher values provide more precise alignment but increase processing time.\n",
    "      - Set to `1` to disable subpixel alignment for faster processing.\n",
    "  - `SKIP_CYCLES`: Optional. List of cycle indices to skip during alignment. Defaults to `None`\n",
    "      - Use this to exclude problematic cycles that would interfere with alignment\n",
    "      - Example: `[1]` to skip the first cycle, `[1, 6]` to skip cycles 1 and 6\n",
    "      - Skipped cycles are completely removed from processing and will not appear in final results\n",
    "  - `MANUAL_BACKGROUND_CYCLE`: Optional. Specific cycle to use as the source for segmentation background channels. Defaults to `None`\n",
    "      - Use this when you have segmentation channels (e.g., DAPI, Vimentin) in a specific cycle that you want propagated to all cycles\n",
    "      - If not specified, automatically selects the cycle with the most extra (non-GTAC) channels\n",
    "      - Example: `3` to use cycle 3 as the source for background channels\n",
    "      - Note: This refers to the original cycle number before any cycles are skipped\n",
    "      - **Only works with simple channel configurations** (see note below)\n",
    "  - `MANUAL_CHANNEL_MAPPING`: Optional. Explicit specification of which channels are present in each cycle. Defaults to `None`\n",
    "      - Required when channel structure varies across cycles in non-standard ways\n",
    "      - Provide a list of channel name lists, one per cycle, matching the order channels appear in each cycle's image data\n",
    "      - The function will map channels by name to create the final output matching `CHANNEL_NAMES`\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note on Channel Configuration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  SBS images are commonly generated in two ways:\n",
    "  1. **Same channels across all cycles** - All cycles have identical channel structure (e.g., all have DAPI, Vimentin, G, T, A, C)\n",
    "  2. **Base channels + one background cycle** - Most cycles have only base channels (G, T, A, C), and one cycle has additional channels for segmentation (e.g., DAPI, Vimentin) at the beginning or end of the channel array\n",
    "\n",
    "  If your imaging setup deviates from these approaches (e.g., some cycles missing channels that are in the middle of your target channel order), you must use `MANUAL_CHANNEL_MAPPING` to explicitly specify which channels are\n",
    "  present in each cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** If `CHANNEL_NAMES = [\"DAPI\", \"Vimentin\", \"G\", \"T\", \"A\", \"C\"]` but only cycle 3 has Vimentin:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  MANUAL_CHANNEL_MAPPING = [\n",
    "      [\"DAPI\", \"G\", \"T\", \"A\", \"C\"],              # Cycle 1: no Vimentin\n",
    "      [\"DAPI\", \"G\", \"T\", \"A\", \"C\"],              # Cycle 2: no Vimentin\n",
    "      [\"DAPI\", \"Vimentin\", \"G\", \"T\", \"A\", \"C\"],  # Cycle 3: has Vimentin\n",
    "      [\"DAPI\", \"G\", \"T\", \"A\", \"C\"],              # Cycle 4: no Vimentin\n",
    "      # ... repeat for all cycles\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  MANUAL_BACKGROUND_CYCLE = 3  # Source for Vimentin propagation\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  The function will copy Vimentin from cycle 3 to all other cycles, creating output with shape (n_cycles, 6, height, width) where all cycles have the full `CHANNEL_NAMES` channel order."

If spots are contained in nuclei, there is no need to segment cell bodies. This may speed up analysis.\n\n#### Cellpose Parameters (if using \"cellpose\")\n- `CELLPOSE_MODEL`: CellPose model to use. Options: \"cyto3\" (default), \"cyto2\", \"cyto\", or \"cpsam\" (requires Cellpose 4.x).\n- `CELL_FLOW_THRESHOLD` & `NUCLEI_FLOW_THRESHOLD`: Flow threshold for Cellpose segmentation. Default is 0.4.\n- `CELL_CELLPROB_THRESHOLD` & `NUCLEI_CELLPROB_THRESHOLD`: Cell probability threshold for Cellpose. Default is 0.\n- `HELPER_INDEX`: (Optional) Index of additional channel to help with CPSAM segmentation. Only used with `cellpose_model=\"cpsam\"`. Default is None.\n- Note: For Cellpose 3.x models (cyto3, cyto2), nuclei and cell diameters will be estimated automatically. For CPSAM (Cellpose 4.x), diameters can be left as None and will be estimated from initial segmentation results.\n\n#### StarDist Parameters (if using \"stardist\")\n- `STARDIST_MODEL`: StarDist model type. Default is \"2D_versatile_fluo\".\n- `CELL_PROB_THRESHOLD` & `NUCLEI_PROB_THRESHOLD`: Probability threshold for segmentation. Default is 0.479071.\n- `CELL_NMS_THRESHOLD` & `NUCLEI_NMS_THRESHOLD`: Non-maximum suppression threshold. Default is 0.3.\n\n#### Watershed Parameters (if using \"watershed\")\n- `THRESHOLD_DAPI`: Threshold for nuclei segmentation. \n- `THRESHOLD_CELL`: Threshold for cell boundary segmentation.\n- `NUCLEUS_AREA`: Range for filtering nuclei by area as a tuple (min, max)."

    "- `GENE_ID_COL`: Column name containing gene IDs (e.g., \"gene_id\", \"ensembl_id\"). Set to `None` if not needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Mode Parameters:**\n",
    "- `BARCODE_COL`: Column containing full barcode sequences (e.g., \"sgRNA\", \"guide_sequence\")\n",
    "- `PREFIX_LENGTH`: Total barcode length BEFORE skipping cycles\n",
    "  - Final length = PREFIX_LENGTH - number of skipped cycles\n",

    "  - Set to `None` if no cycles were skipped\n",

    "- `PREFIX_MAP`: Column with MAP region barcode sequences (e.g., \"iBAR2\")\n",
    "- `PREFIX_RECOMB`: Column with RECOMB region barcode sequences (optional)\n",
    "- `MAP_PREFIX_LENGTH`: Total bases BEFORE skipping for MAP region\n",
